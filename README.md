RITU - Rang, Illumination, Treasures, Unity

Ritu has been conceived to unveil the true grit and shine of Rajiv Gandhi Institute Of Technology, a platform to test and enhance the student community’s fineness. With an estimated budget of over 20 lakhs, it’ll be nothing short of grandeur with the pinnacle of technical stateliness and a robust exemplar of top-class management.
